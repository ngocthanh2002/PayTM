- After looking at the above metrics of customerâ€™s payment behaviors,  we want to analyze the distribution of each metric.  Before calculating and plotting the distribution to check the frequency of values in each metric, we need to group the observations into range.
Based on the result of 2.1, retrieve a report that includes the following columns: metric, minimum value, maximum value and average value of these metrics: 
   - The total charged amount
